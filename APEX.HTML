           <p id="c">
            1. <b>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</b> is the simulation of human intelligence in machines. <br> 
            2. AI enables computers to perform tasks that typically require human cognition, such as learning and problem-solving.   <br> 
            3. It includes subfields like machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing.   <br> 
            4. AI systems can analyze large amounts of data and make decisions based on patterns.   <br> 
            5. It is used in various applications, including robotics, healthcare, finance, and customer service.   <br> 
            6. AI can be categorized into <b>Narrow AI</b> (task-specific) and <b>General AI</b> (human-like intelligence).  <br>  
            7. Technologies like neural networks and reinforcement learning improve AI performance.   <br> 
            8. AI-powered chatbots, virtual assistants, and self-driving cars are real-world examples.   <br> 
            9. Ethical concerns include data privacy, job displacement, and decision-making biases.   <br> 
            10. AI continues to evolve, shaping the future of technology and human interactions. <br>
